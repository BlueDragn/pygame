## Overview
This project is a clone of a JavaScript game developed by [Franks Laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/Frankslaboratory) using Pygame. The purpose of this project is to learn game development using python.

## The Challenge
The challenge is to recreate the game using Pygame, including the game logic, animation, and user interface. I am using the process and logic as per tutorial but have to write code in python and make modifications to fit my needs.

## Our Process
- Analyzed the original game and broke down its components.
- Recreated the game logic using Pygame.
- Debugged the code and made necessary modifications.(in process)
- Added sound effects and improved graphics.(in process)
- Tested the game and made further improvements.(in process)

## Built With
- Python
- Pygame

## What We Learned
- How to use Pygame to develop games in Python.
- Debugging techniques and problem-solving skills.
- Sound and graphics integration into a game.

## Continued Development
- Implementing more levels and increasing the difficulty.
- Adding more sound effects and music.
- Improving graphics and user interface.
